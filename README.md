## Hello Everybody 👋

### **A little about my career**

🧑🏾‍💻 &nbsp;Senior software developer with over 10 years of experience;

🔭 &nbsp;Currently working as Senior iOS Developer at [LetsGetChecked](https://www.letsgetchecked.com/);

🗝️ &nbsp;Before Critical Techworks, I worked in several mid to large size companies such as [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), [Critical Techworks](https://www.criticaltechworks.com/) and Samsung;

🚗 &nbsp;In the current days, my focus is on research and development in the medical area, integrating medical devices into customer apps.

🍏 &nbsp;My passion is working with the Apple environment, building apps for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and Apple TV

📚 &nbsp;Current stack: Swift, Objective-C, Carthage, Cocoapods, Fastlane and Kotlin. Passionate about TDD, DDD and Clean Architecture. 

👯 &nbsp;But more important than dev stuff is to work as a team, support people's journeys and be able to add even a little bit to people's lives.
